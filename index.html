My main research areas are computer vision, machine learning, and data mining. 
A large part of my current work focuses on gesture and sign language recognition, human motion analysis, and similarity-based retrieval in image, video and multimedia databases. Details on the various projects
I've been working on are provided in my <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/publications">
publications</a>. Brief descriptions of selected ongoing and past projects can be found at the following links:

<ul>

<li>
<b>
<a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/projects/cognitive_assessment">
Assessing cognitive skills in children through performance in physical and computer-based tasks
</a></b> 
<br>

Developing computer vision and data mining methods for assessing cognitive skills in children, based on the children's performance in structured physical and computer-based tasks.

</li><li>
<b>
<a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/projects/asl_dictionary">
ASL dictionary search
</a></b> <br>

Developing computer vision methods for a system that lets users search dictionaries of American Sign Language (ASL), so as to look up the meaning of unknown signs. Videos and annotations from this project are <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/asl_lexicon/">available here</a>.

</li><li><b>
<a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/projects/subsequence_matching">
Subsequence matching in large databases of time series and strings.
</a></b> <br>

The goal of this project is to develop methods for efficient identification of subsequence matches in large databases of time series. Demo applications are being developed for sign language video, query by humming, and handwritten text search. Code and data from our SIGMOD 2008 paper are <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/projects/ebsm/">available here</a>.

</li><li><b><a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/nearest_neighbors">Nearest-neighbor retrieval and classification </a></b> <br>

Information on how to download code and datasets for <a href="publications/athitsos_pami2008.pdf">BoostMap</a> and <a href="publications/athitsos_icde2008.pdf">Distance-Based Hashing</a> can be found <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/nearest_neighbors#code_data">by clicking here.</a>

</li><li>

<b><a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/variable_structure">

Detecting shape classes of variable structure in cluttered images

</a></b>
</li><li>
<b><a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/handpose/handpose.html">Hand pose estimation</a></b> <br>


Code and data for this project can be downloaded as a zipped file, with size approximately 100MB, from
